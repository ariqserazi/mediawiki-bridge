# 📚 MediaWiki Bridge for Lore GPT Actions

✨ Canon first infrastructure for lore accurate GPTs ✨

This project provides a FastAPI based bridge service that allows a Custom GPT Action to pull **canon text directly from MediaWiki powered wikis**, with strict source control and citation discipline.

It is built for:

* Long form lore analysis  
* Video essay scripting  
* Canon verification  
* Franchise accurate writing workflows  

The end goal is a **Lore GPT** that can explain fictional worlds while always citing the exact wiki pages it used.

## 🧠 What this project does

You are building a small but powerful pipeline composed of four parts.

### 🔹 1. MediaWiki Bridge API
A public HTTPS FastAPI service that ChatGPT Actions can call.

This is the core component.  
It enables canon lookups inside a Custom GPT.

### 🔹 2. MediaWiki MCP Server
An optional local tool server for development and testing.

This is not required for end users once the Bridge API is deployed publicly.

### 🔹 3. Render deployment
Hosts the Bridge API and provides a stable HTTPS URL required by GPT Actions.

### 🔹 4. GPT Action
Connects ChatGPT to the Bridge API using an OpenAPI schema.

✅ In production usage, only the Bridge API and GPT Action are required.  
Friends and users do not need Docker or the MCP server.

## 📂 Repository layout

Recommended project structure:

```text
.
├── app.py            # FastAPI service code
├── requirements.txt  # Python dependencies
├── Dockerfile        # Container build
├── openapi.yaml      # GPT Action schema
└── README.md
```

If your main file is named differently, adjust commands accordingly.

---

## ⚙️ Environment variables

All environment variables are optional.

* `USER_AGENT`  
  Default value is a mediawiki bridge version string

* `HTTP_TIMEOUT`  
  Default value is 30.0 seconds

🔐 No API keys are required.

---

## 🚀 Running locally without Docker

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn httpx
```

Run the server:

```bash
uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Open in your browser:

```text
http://localhost:8000/health
http://localhost:8000/docs
```

---

## 🐳 Running the Bridge with Docker

### 📄 Dockerfile example

Create a file named `Dockerfile`:

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt /app/requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r /app/requirements.txt

COPY . /app

ENV PORT=8000
EXPOSE 8000

CMD ["uvicorn", "app:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

If your Python file is named `main.py`, change `app:app` to `main:app`.

---

### 📦 requirements.txt example

```text
fastapi==0.115.0
uvicorn[standard]==0.30.6
httpx==0.27.2
```

---

### 🏗️ Build and run the container

Build the image:

```bash
docker build -t mediawiki-bridge .
```

Run the container:

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 --name mediawiki-bridge mediawiki-bridge
```

Test the service:

```text
http://localhost:8000/health
```

---

## 🔍 Common API test calls

Resolve a topic to a working wiki base:

```text
http://localhost:8000/resolve?topic=Devil%20May%20Cry%205
```

Search within a resolved wiki:

```text
http://localhost:8000/search?q=Vergil&wiki=https%3A%2F%2Fdevilmaycry.fandom.com
```

Fetch a page extract and citeable URL:

```text
http://localhost:8000/page?title=Vergil&wiki=https%3A%2F%2Fdevilmaycry.fandom.com
```

💡 Best practice  
Always call resolve first, then pass the returned wiki URL into `search` and `page`.

---

## 🧪 MediaWiki MCP Server

This step is optional and intended for local development only.  
GPT Actions do not talk to MCP directly.

Clone the MCP server repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shiquda/mediawiki-mcp-server
cd mediawiki-mcp-server
```

Build the image:

```bash
docker build -t mediawiki-mcp-server .
```

Run the server:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 --name mediawiki-mcp-server mediawiki-mcp-server
```

---

## ☁️ Deploying the Bridge to Render

Render provides the public HTTPS endpoint required by GPT Actions.

### 📌 Deploy from GitHub

1. Push your bridge code to a GitHub repository  
2. In Render, create a new Web Service  
3. Connect the GitHub repository  
4. Select Docker as the environment  

### ⚙️ Render settings

* Build Command  
  Leave empty when using Docker

* Start Command  
  Leave empty when using Docker

* Port  
  Automatically mapped by Render

* Environment variables  
  Optional `USER_AGENT`, `HTTP_TIMEOUT`

---

### ✅ After deployment

Your service URL will look like:

```text
https://your-service-name.onrender.com
```

Verify:

```text
https://your-service-name.onrender.com/health
https://your-service-name.onrender.com/openapi.json
https://your-service-name.onrender.com/docs
```

If `/health` returns ok, the service is live.

## 🤖 Adding the GPT Action in ChatGPT

### Step 1

* Open ChatGPT  
* Go to Explore GPTs  
* Create a GPT  
* Open Configure  
* Navigate to Actions  
* Click Add Action  
* Choose Import from OpenAPI  

### Step 2

Paste or upload your OpenAPI schema.

Ensure the server URL matches your Render deployment:

```yaml
servers:
  - url: https://your-service-name.onrender.com
```

### Step 3

Test the Action inside the GPT builder.

Recommended call order:

* resolveWiki  
* searchWiki  
* getWikiPage  

---

## 🧭 Recommended Lore GPT behavior

Suggested instruction logic for your Custom GPT:

* Resolve the franchise topic  
* Search the resolved wiki for relevant pages  
* Fetch page extracts and URLs  
* Cite every factual claim using returned URLs  
* Use only Fandom and wiki.gg  
* Explicitly say when canon cannot be verified  

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Resolve returns could not resolve topic

This usually means the wiki site name differs from the user input.

Example:

* Devil May Cry 5  
* devilmaycry.fandom.com  

Fixes:

* Try a shorter franchise name  
* Inspect the `tried` list returned by resolve  

---

### Works in docs but fails in GPT Actions

Common causes:

* OpenAPI schema mismatch  
* Schema not refreshed after code changes  
* Older schema imported by another user  

Fix:

* Open `/openapi.json` from the deployed service  
* Reimport the schema in the GPT Action  

---

### Fandom quirks

Some Fandom sites behave inconsistently.

If site probing fails but search works, update your probe logic to use a minimal search query instead.

---

### CORS issues

GPT Actions call your service server to server.  
CORS is usually not required unless you also build a browser based frontend.

---

## 🔐 Security notes

Outbound requests are restricted by hostname suffix.

Allowed domains:

* fandom.com  
* wiki.gg  

This prevents the service from being abused as a general purpose proxy.
